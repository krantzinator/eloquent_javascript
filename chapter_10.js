/* Exercise 3: dependency management & circular dependencies,
where module A depends on B, and B also depends on A.
CommonJS modules allow a limited form: it works as long as the modules do not replace their default
exports object with another value and start accessing each otherâ€™s interface only after they finish loading.
Think of a way in which support for this feature could be implemented.

/*
  Need to put limiters on both _exports_ and load timing. How?
  - Wrap the loader in a function ensuring all modules and dependencies are loaded
    before calling any functions
    - would the _define_ function work to accomplish this?
    - on second thought, I see _define_ is not part of CommonJS
  - Ensure _exports_ values aren't being replaced by the co-dependent modules
    - I don't fully *get* how exports operate.
    - I know there is an order here that needs to be changed up, to make sure loading happens before
      exports are written/over-written. But I'm not sure how it would be implemented.
